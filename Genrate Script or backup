------------------for Genrate Script or backup -> 17/aug/2024--

We transfer file by 2 ways 
1) Using creating script (extension .sql)
2) Using Backup (Extension .bak)

Limitation of backup file :
---Version problem:
if we create backup file in version 2022 and send someone who used lower than version 2022 than backup file not restore beacuse problem in version.

---Limitation of  generate file
Any one can open this file
if we want to transfer large amount of data to user than we generate script which consume more memory compare to back file.


--- Create Generate Script File

Step1 : right click on your database -> Tasks ->  select Generate script -> Next

Step2 : Select the database object in script.
      (You have 2 option. First Script entrie database and all database objects and second Select Specific database objects.) -> Next

Step3 : Specify How scripts should be saved.
        (Save as a script file -> Select path and write file name)

  Click on Advances -> ->  types of data to script ->  Select Schema and data
  (Schema only :  only struture will generate as a script,
   Schema and data : Both Struture and Records  will generate as a script,
   Data only : only records will generate as a script(Only tables records no any view,procedure, function or index) )
 -> ok -> Next -> Finish
